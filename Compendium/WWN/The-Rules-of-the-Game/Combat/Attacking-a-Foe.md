title: Attacking a Foe

To attack, make a **hit roll**. This costs a Main Action and be within the weapon's range. Roll a `d20 + combat skill level + attack bonus + attribute modifier`. Succeed if you meet or beat the AC, which means you may roll damage listed on the weapon against the target's HP.
Otherwise, you miss, but still may deal [[Shock-Damage|Shock Damage]].

There are different circumstances which may change this: 
- ***Unskilled***: If the attacker is -1 in the relevant skill, they suffer -2 to their roll.
- ***Lethality***: By default, attacks are lethal. Unimportant NPCs will be instantly dead. For non-lethal attacks, 0 HP indicates a 10-minute unconsciousness. 
- ***Knock-out:*** Throwing fists can always be lethal or unlethal. For blunt weaponry, the final blow may be non-lethal if Stab check succeeds against the target's Morale score. Otherwise, it's lethal. Oops!

## Hit Roll Modifiers
The following are simply examples and GMs should make their own adjustments as they see fit.

| Circumstance                               | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Ranged attack at distant, prone enemy      | -2  |
| Attack at adjacent, prone enemy            | =2  |
| Melee attack while prone                   | -4  |
| Target is behind half-cover                | -2  |
| Target is behind full-cover                | -4  |
| Ranged attack while being melee'd by a foe | -4  |

> There are no penalties for shooting through an ally's space to an enemy's. The modifiers are already factor in this. 

## Dual-Wielding Weapons

Players may dual wield as long as they have Stab-1. If they do, then:

- They gain +2 to damage rolls (but not shock)
- They suffer -1 to hit. 
- Only one weapon can deal the damaging blow.
