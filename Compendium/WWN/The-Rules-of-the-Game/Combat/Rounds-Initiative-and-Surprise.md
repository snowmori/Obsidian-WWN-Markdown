title: Rounds Initiative and Surprise
---
Time-sensitive situations are split into ***rounds*** which are 6 seconds long. In each round, each participant takes a ***turn*** as dictated by initiative. 

***Initiative*** is the order of turns in a round. To determine, roll `dice: 1d8 + DEX mod`. There are two different ways the GM can handle initiative. 
- **Group Initiative:** Each side has initiative, usually just PC vs enemies. The highest DEX modifier in the group is used. 
- **Individual Initiative:** Each participant has their own initiative and uses their own scores. 

>[!info] Surprise!
> If surprise is possible, am opposed skill check occurs to see if the defenders (Wis/Notice) can avoid surprise of the attackers (Dex/Sneak). If the attackers succeed, they get a full turn prior to initiative.
