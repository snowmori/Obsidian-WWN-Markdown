***Shock*** is the *minimum* *harm* that occurs even on a missed melee attack or a low damage roll. It is listed as DAMAGE/AC: 
- The Damage dealt is `listed damage + attribute modifier`, and any other special bonuses if noted.
- The AC dictates the maximum Armor Class shock can be dealt to. 

*For example:* An attack misses an attack with a Shock 4/15 weapon. The target's AC is 15, so they are dealt 4 dmg + modifier in shock.
