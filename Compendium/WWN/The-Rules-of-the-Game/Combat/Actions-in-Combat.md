title: Actions in Combat

- **Main Actions:** The primary activity during the round. A complex action like attacking, casting, and helping.
- **Move Actions:** The secondary activity during the round, usually moving up to the character's move speed. Movement can't be split and will invoke an Instant attack if they don't Withdrawal.
- **On Turn Actions:** Swift moves that aren't too complex, but must be performed only on their turn. 
- **Instant Actions:** Quick and basic actions that can be used anytime. Typically restricted to special abilities, and ultimately GM's discretion.

For more examples on how these work and what can be performed in combat, see [[Common-Combat-Actions]].
