title: Opposed Skill Check
---

Players may need to directly oppose an NPC in a test of skill. 

- All roll the relevant skill and its appropriate modifiers
- NPCs add their skill bonus, unless they are clearly unskilled at the challenge
- PCs succeed if they meet or beat the NPC
- As always, GM decides relevant skills and what's applicable.
