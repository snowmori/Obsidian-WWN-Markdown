title: Aiding a Skill Check
---
Other players can assist their party members in skill checks. 

- The helper states how they aid the other player
- The GM calls for a relevant skill check at the same difficulty as the first check
- On a succeed, the first player gets +1

The PC can only ever get +1 from help, even if other party members pitch in.
