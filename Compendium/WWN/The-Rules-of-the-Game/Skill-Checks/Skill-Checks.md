## Skill Checks

When faced with a challenge that proves a test of skill, roll `dice: 2d6` + skill level + attribute modifier. If you meet or beat the set difficulty score, you succeed. Otherwise, they fail or succeed at a great cost, as determined by the GM. 

Certain additional modifiers may come into play. If a PC does not have a skill (minimum at level 0), they add -1 to their roll. The GM may also add circumstance bonuses up to +/- 2. 

>[!question] When to Call for a Check
> It is important not to over or underutilize skill checks. They should be called for in a situation where the result matters and the PC would reasonably have a chance of failure. Checks aren't needed if the PC's background competency covers the task.
