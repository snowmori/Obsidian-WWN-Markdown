## The Basic Systems
A summary of the core systems WWN uses.

- **[[Skill-Checks|Skill checks:]]**: When a PC attempts something unrelated to combat that requires skill. 
- **[[Saving-Throws|Saving throws]]:** When a PC seeks to avoid incoming misfortunes.
- **[[Combat]]**: When the PCs draw weapons and enter the fray.

## Using These Systems

>[!tip]  Rulings over Rules
> If the rules are unclear or the edge-case can't be found... make a (reasonable) judgement call and move on! OSR takes the philosophy "rulings over rules" to encourage play over scouring a rulebook.

Players should have a grasp of how rules come into play, but ultimately the GM will be the referee for these. For players, a good method of play is to simply state what you want the do and let the gamemaster interpret what system is used. 

Ultimately, the gamemaster decided what type of system is called for and if a roll is even possible. They may make rules not found here in favor of a ruling that better fits the table.
