Time is not strictly tracked during play, unless it needs to be. Instead, it is split between **scenes** and **turns**. **Scenes** focus on one section where the PCs are trying to do one thing. **Turns** occur during more complex scenes, such as combat or exploration, and are used to keep track of orders.
