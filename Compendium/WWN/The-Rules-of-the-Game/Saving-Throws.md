**Saving Throws** are called for by the GM when a PC has a chance to avoid doom or the worst effects of something. For instance, some saving throws come from saving against certain monster abilities. 

**Rolling:** roll a `dice: 1d20` trying to meet or beat the saving throw score. For PCs, the saving throw score is `16 - the highest relevant modifier`. 

There are four types of throws.

1. **Evasion saves** (INT/DEX): for tests of dodging, nimbleness, and quick reactions.
2. **Mental saves** (WIS/CHA): persist through volition, willpower, and heart. 
3. **Physical saves** (STR/CON): resist atrophy using the character's vitality and strength.
4. **Luck saves**: for when only lady fate and the luck of the dice could get a hero out of danger. 

>[!info] For Avoiding Peril
> These throws are for last chances to avoid the worst of a dire fate, especially when no other dice are there for determining it. 

# Monster and Saving Throws
NPCs only have one saving throw score instead of multiple to encompass their own saves against PC effects or other dangers.
